## Linux Shell
Shell is an interface to the operating system
  * Run Program
  * Manipulate files

Two kinds of Shells:
  1. Graphical Shells
	* Windows, Mac, Linux
	* use a cursor / pointer

	* drag and drop
	* really intuitive
	* Cumbersome for tasks that are uncommon i.e. more complicated
  2. Command Line Shell
	* traditional interface to Unix/Linux
	* type command on a command prompt
	* compose basic command to accomplish complicated tasks

## History of Linux Shell
  - desentent of the original Unix Shell (1970s) by Stephen Bourne
  - C shell (csh)
  - Turbo shell (tcsh)
  - Bourne Again shell (bash)

`$> echo $0` show the kind of shell is being used
`- bash`
`$> bash` change to bash

## Linux File System
  - files 
  - directories <- can contain other files

```
e.g.			/ (root directory)
			/	 /		\		\
		bin		etc		home	usr
		/		/		\		/	\
	bash	shell	nanaeem	  bin	include
					/	\
				cs241	cs246
						/	\
					1151	1155
```

`$f(x)=\frac{x!}{x^x^x}$`
